# Planning Planned Parenthood
Anika and Cat's 2020 Hack Beanpot project!

## Inspiration
We wanted to find and use data in a way that would impact the healthcare industry on a local level. Anika teaches 9th grade health classes in the Boston Public School System through Peer Health Exchange. While the class covers many topics, it seems that the teenagers always have the most question's about sex and relationships. While she is a trained educator, it would be great if there were more nearby resources that Anika could point them to when she doesn't know the answer. So we started looking for data about clinics and publicly funded health centers.

Our focus grew from Boston and teens to Massachusetts and its lack of Planned Parenthoods when we found a dataset detailing the need for publicly funded contraceptive services and supplies in all of the different counties across Massachusetts.

## What's Next for PPP
It would be awesome if we could reach out to Planned Parenthood to possibly use some of their data about the subject. Because it would work best as an internal tool for them it would be okay to use their private datasets. This would mean that further refining of the algorithm would also have to be done.

## Setup for your own computer!
1. Clone this repository to your local machine. E.g., in your terminal / command prompt `CD` to where you want this the folder for this activity to be. Then run `git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>`

1. `CD` or open a terminal / command prompt window into the cloned folder.

1. Start a simple python webserver. E.g., `python -m http.server`, `python3 -m http.server`, or `py -m http.server`. If you are using python 2 you will need to use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` instead, but please switch to python 3.

1. Wait for the output: `Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/)`.

1. Now open your web browser (Firefox or Chrome) and navigate to the URL: http://localhost:8000
